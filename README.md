# polyomino-criterion 

This project is contains a C++ version of the [Langerman Winslow algorithm](https://github.com/andrewwinslow/tiling) to determine whether a given polyform is isohedral. The code also has implementations for the remaining 2 isohedral types not covered in the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02762).

**The code is experimental: use or study at your own risk**

# Installation

The executable from this project takes in files created by the gen program from [heesch-sat](https://github.com/isohedral/heesch-sat).

Code is built with the Makefile `cpp/Makefile`. Requires a C++ compiler that supports at least C++17.

# Running the software 

## Determining Isohedral Polyforms 

The `isohedral_e2e` tool uses variants of the Langerman Winslow algorithm to determine whether polyforms are isohedral.  It accepts the following command-line parameters:

 * `<filename>`: The path to the input file containing polyforms to check for isohedrality. The file is expected to be in the format generated by the gen program in [heesch-sat](https://github.com/isohedral/heesch-sat).
 * `<grid type>`: The grid type. Currently the supported grids are omino, hex, kite, iamond (which all correspond to types in [heesch-sat](https://github.com/isohedral/heesch-sat)).

As a typical example, `./isohedral_e2e polyominos.txt omino` will read all polyominos in polyominos.txt and report how many tile the plane isohedrally.
